    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice, from 1 large orange</li>
        <li>3/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice, from 4 to 5 medium limes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup olive or avocado oil</li>
        <li>4 large garlic cloves, crushed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon fine salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>2 pounds skirt steak</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a reusable food storage container, mix together the orange juice, lime juice, soy sauce, vinegar, oil, garlic, salt, pepper, cumin, and oregano.</li>
        <li>Add the meat, turning in the marinade to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 5 hours or up to 12 hours. Flip the meat around every couple of hours so that it marinates evenly. Let the meat rest in the marinade at room temperature for 1 hour before grilling. </li>
        <li>Remove the meat from the marinade, allowing the excess to drip off. Discard the marinade.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to 450 F or prepare a hot charcoal grill fire. Grill the meat over direct heat, flipping once halfway through cooking, until slightly charred around the edges, 8 to 10 minutes total.</li>
        <li>Place the cooked meat on a cutting board and slice against the grain into 1/4 to 1/2-inch-thick strips. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
